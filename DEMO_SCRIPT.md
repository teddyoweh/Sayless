# 🎬 Sayless Demo Script - "The AI Git Workflow Revolution"

## 🎯 **Demo Goal**
Show developers how Sayless transforms their daily git workflow from tedious manual work into an intelligent, automated experience that saves hours every day.

## 🎪 **The Hook (0-30 seconds)**

### **Opening Line** 
*"What if I told you that you could cut your git workflow time by 80% and never write another boring commit message again?"*

### **Visual Setup**
- Clean terminal window
- VS Code with a messy project (multiple changed files)
- Split screen showing before/after

### **The Problem Statement**
*"Every day, developers spend HOURS on repetitive git tasks - writing commit messages, creating branches, reviewing PRs, managing dependencies. It's 2025, and we're still doing this manually?"*
