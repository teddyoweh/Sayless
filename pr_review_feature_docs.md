# Check current branch for dependency issues
sayless review-enhanced --current --type dependencies
```

## Configuration

The PR review feature uses the same configuration as other sayless features:
- **AI Provider**: OpenAI or Ollama
- **GitHub Token**: Required for posting reviews
- **Model Settings**: Configurable AI model

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Review Type
- **Quick**: Small PRs, hotfixes, documentation changes
- **Detailed**: Large features, architectural changes, complex logic
- **Security**: Authentication changes, data handling, external integrations
- **Performance**: Database changes, algorithms, high-traffic features
- **Dependencies**: Package updates, new dependencies, security patches

### Review Workflow Integration
1. Use bulk review for daily PR triage
2. Apply specific review types based on PR content
3. Compare review types for critical changes
4. Post reviews to GitHub for team visibility

### Confidence Score Interpretation
- **90-100%**: High confidence, can auto-post
- **70-89%**: Good confidence, review before posting
- **50-69%**: Medium confidence, manual review recommended
- **Below 50%**: Low confidence, manual review required

## Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling:
- **Fallback AI Providers**: Ollama fallback for OpenAI failures
- **Large Diff Handling**: Intelligent truncation for large changes
- **Network Issues**: Graceful degradation with error messages
- **Invalid PRs**: Clear error messages for missing/invalid PRs

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Custom review templates
